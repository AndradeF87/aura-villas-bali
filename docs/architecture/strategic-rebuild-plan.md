## 2. Technical Architecture

### 2.1 Architecture Decision: Hybrid Microservices

#### Core Architecture Philosophy
```typescript
interface AuraArchitecture {
  pattern: "Hybrid Microservices with Monolithic Foundation";
  rationale: "Gradual decomposition for scalability";
  deployment: "Containerized with Kubernetes";
  communication: "Event-driven + API Gateway";
  dataStrategy: "Database per service + Shared read replicas";
}
```

#### System Architecture Overview
```mermaid
graph TB
    subgraph "Client Layer"
        WEB[Web App]
        MOBILE[Mobile App]
        ADMIN[Admin Portal]

graph LR
    subgraph "Operational Databases"
        MAIN[(Main PostgreSQL)]
        CACHE[(Redis Cache)]
        SEARCH[(Elasticsearch)]
    end
    
    subgraph "Analytics"
        DW[(Data Warehouse)]

    end
    
    MAIN --> DW
    CACHE --> STREAM
    SEARCH --> STREAM
    
    OTA_DB --> STREAM
    WEATHER --> STREAM
    MAPS --> STREAM
```

#### Core Database Schema
```sql
-- Core villa management schema
CREATE SCHEMA villa_core;

-- Villa entities
CREATE TABLE villa_core.villas (
    id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
    name VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    slug VARCHAR(255) UNIQUE NOT NULL,
    story TEXT,
    story_teaser VARCHAR(500),
    location_id UUID REFERENCES villa_core.locations(id),

```

#### Caching Strategy
```typescript
interface CachingStrategy {
  layers: {
    cdn: "CloudFlare for static assets";
    redis: "Application-level caching";
    database: "Query result caching";
    browser: "Client-side caching";

  };
  
  invalidation: {
    strategy: "Event-driven cache invalidation";
    triggers: ["villa updates", "booking changes", "pricing updates"];
  };
}
```

### 2.4 API Design Strategy

#### RESTful API Architecture

  "DELETE /api/v1/villas/{id}": "Delete villa (admin)";
  
  // Search and filtering
  "GET /api/v1/villas/search": "Search villas with filters";
  "GET /api/v1/villas/featured": "Get featured villas";
  "GET /api/v1/villas/by-location/{area}": "Get villas by location";
  
  // Availability and pricing
  "GET /api/v1/villas/{id}/availability": "Check availability";
  "GET /api/v1/villas/{id}/pricing": "Get pricing for dates";

  "POST /api/v1/bookings": "Create new booking";
  "PUT /api/v1/bookings/{id}": "Update booking status";
  "DELETE /api/v1/bookings/{id}": "Cancel booking";
  
  // Payment processing
  "POST /api/v1/bookings/{id}/payment": "Process payment";
  "GET /api/v1/bookings/{id}/payment-status": "Check payment status";
}

// Analytics and Reporting API
interface AnalyticsAPI {
  "GET /api/v1/analytics/villa-performance": "Villa performance metrics";
  "GET /api/v1/analytics/revenue-trends": "Revenue trending data";
  "GET /api/v1/analytics/occupancy-rates": "Occupancy analytics";
  "GET /api/v1/analytics/guest-insights": "Guest behavior analytics";
}
```

  areaGuide: AreaGuide
}

type Query {
  # Villa queries
  villa(id: ID, slug: String): Villa
  villas(filters: VillaFilters, sort: VillaSortInput, pagination: PaginationInput): VillaConnection!
  featuredVillas(limit: Int): [Villa!]!
  
  # Search queries
  searchVillas(query: String!, filters: VillaFilters): VillaSearchResult!
  villaRecommendations(guestPreferences: GuestPreferences!): [Villa!]!
  
  # Analytics queries (authenticated)
  villaAnalytics(villaId: ID!): VillaAnalytics!
  ownerDashboard: OwnerDashboard!
}

type Mutation {
  # Booking mutations
  submitBookingInquiry(input: BookingInquiryInput!): BookingInquiryResult!
  confirmBooking(bookingId: ID!, paymentInput: PaymentInput!): BookingConfirmationResult!
  
  # Villa management (admin/owner)
  createVilla(input: VillaInput!): Villa!
  updateVilla(id: ID!, input: VillaUpdateInput!): Villa!
  updateVillaAvailability(villaId: ID!, dates: [AvailabilityInput!]!): [AvailabilitySlot!]!
}

type Subscription {
  # Real-time updates
  bookingUpdates(villaId: ID!): BookingUpdate!
  availabilityChanges(villaId: ID!): AvailabilityUpdate!
  priceUpdates(villaId: ID!): PriceUpdate!
}
```

### 2.5 Security Architecture
