# ADR-002: Property Management Service Architecture

## Status
Proposed

## Context
AURA Villas Bali requires a comprehensive property management service architecture that addresses villa owner pain points while leveraging technology for competitive advantage. The system must support a selective, boutique approach while maintaining scalability for growth.

## Decision Drivers
- **Owner Transparency**: Complete visibility into operations and financials
- **Service Quality**: Maintain boutique-level service at scale
- **Technology Integration**: Leverage AI and IoT for operational efficiency
- **Cultural Authenticity**: Preserve authentic Balinese hospitality
- **Scalability**: Support growth from 3 to 50+ properties
- **Differentiation**: Unique value proposition vs. competitors

## Considered Options

### Option 1: Traditional Property Management Model
- **Pros**: Simple implementation, established processes
- **Cons**: Limited transparency, manual processes, no differentiation

### Option 2: Technology-First Automated Model
- **Pros**: High efficiency, low operational costs
- **Cons**: Loss of personal touch, cultural disconnect

### Option 3: Hybrid Boutique Technology Model (Selected)
- **Pros**: Best of both worlds - technology efficiency with human touch
- **Cons**: Higher complexity, significant initial investment

## Decision
We will implement a **Hybrid Boutique Technology Model** with the following architecture:

### Core Components
1. **Three-Tier Service Structure** (15%, 18%, 20-22% commission)
2. **Owner Portal** with real-time dashboards and transparency
3. **AI-Enhanced Operations** for revenue optimization and predictive maintenance
4. **Cultural Integration Framework** for authentic Balinese hospitality
5. **IoT-Enabled Property Monitoring** for proactive maintenance

### Technology Stack
- **Frontend**: React Native (mobile), Next.js (web)
- **Backend**: Node.js microservices with GraphQL API
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with Redis caching
- **AI/ML**: Custom models for pricing and maintenance prediction
- **IoT**: AWS IoT Core with edge computing
- **Integrations**: Stripe, Twilio, major booking platforms

## Consequences

### Positive
- **Competitive Differentiation**: Unique blend of technology and personal service
- **Owner Satisfaction**: Complete transparency and control
- **Operational Efficiency**: AI-driven optimization reduces costs
- **Scalability**: Technology foundation supports growth
- **Cultural Preservation**: Framework maintains authentic experience

### Negative
- **Higher Initial Investment**: Complex system requires significant upfront cost
- **Technical Complexity**: Multiple integrations and AI systems to maintain
- **Staff Training Requirements**: New technology requires extensive training
- **Vendor Dependencies**: Reliance on multiple third-party services

### Risks & Mitigations
1. **Risk**: Technology failures impact service quality
   - **Mitigation**: Comprehensive backup systems and manual processes
   
2. **Risk**: High initial costs strain cash flow
   - **Mitigation**: Phased implementation with revenue milestones
   
3. **Risk**: Staff resistance to new technology
   - **Mitigation**: Comprehensive training and change management program

## Implementation Plan
