### 4.2 Alerting & Response Strategy

```yaml
Alerting Framework:

Critical Alerts (Immediate Response):
  - Site Down: Response time >30 seconds
  - Error Rate: >1% error rate for 5 minutes
  - Database: Connection failures or >5 second queries
  - Payment: Payment processing failures
  Response: PagerDuty → On-call engineer → 5 minute response

High Priority Alerts (15 minute response):
  - Performance: Core Web Vitals <85 for 10 minutes
  - Capacity: >80% resource utilization
  - Security: Unusual traffic patterns
  - Booking: Booking flow >10 second completion
  Response: Slack + Email → Team lead → 15 minute response

Medium Priority Alerts (1 hour response):
  - Performance: Page load time >3 seconds
  - Search: Search response time >1 second
  - Images: Image load failures >5%
  - Cache: Cache hit rate <85%
  Response: Email → Development team → 1 hour response

Low Priority Alerts (24 hour response):
  - Trends: Week-over-week performance degradation
  - Optimization: Optimization opportunities identified
  - Capacity: Future capacity planning alerts
  - Reports: Weekly performance reports
  Response: Dashboard + Email → Product team → 24 hour review
