Privacy Embedded into Design:
  - Privacy requirements in technical specifications
  - Data minimization in system architecture
  - Built-in consent management
  - Technical privacy controls

Full Functionality:
  - Privacy protection without compromising functionality
  - User-friendly privacy controls
  - Transparent data practices
  - Enhanced features through privacy

End-to-End Security:
  - Comprehensive security throughout data lifecycle
  - Secure data transmission and storage
  - Secure data disposal
  - Continuous security monitoring

Visibility and Transparency:
  - Clear privacy policies and notices
  - Data processing transparency
  - Regular privacy reports
  - User dashboard for privacy controls

Respect for User Privacy:
  - User-centric privacy controls
  - Easy consent withdrawal
  - Granular privacy preferences
