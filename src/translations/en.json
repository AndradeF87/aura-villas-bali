      "questions": [
        {
          "question": "How does commission-based pricing work?",
          "answer": "Our commission is calculated as a percentage of your villa's gross monthly revenue after OTA fees. You only pay when you earn, making it risk-free and aligned with your success."
        },
        {
          "question": "Can I combine operations and marketing packages?",
          "answer": "Absolutely! Many of our clients combine operations management with marketing services for comprehensive villa management. We offer special bundled rates for combined packages."
        },
        {
          "question": "What's included in the commission rates?",
          "answer": "Our commission covers all management services listed in each package. Additional costs like maintenance materials, staff salaries (in Essential & Premium), and marketing ad spend are billed separately at cost."
        },
        {
          "question": "How quickly can I see results?",
          "answer": "Most properties see improved occupancy rates within the first 60 days. Our average properties experience a 50% increase in occupancy and 67% increase in revenue within 6 months."
